--- Changed layout to flex instead of floating ---

# resizeBefore() and resizeAfter() seem a bad way to handle resizing of neighbour panes
Plan: change the resizeBefore() and resizeAfter() functions in Divider.js so that it is cleaner and more
obvious what they do.
1: Rename to moveBack/moveForward, indicating where the divider will move. This helps information hiding
and doesn't indicate the implementation just resizes the other panes.
Solved.

# Dividers and Panes both have dupliate code, 1 set of functions for width and 1 set for height
Plan: combine the functions into 1 and just call a getSize() function instead of specifying width or height.
The divider subclasses can implement the getSize() function and return the appropriate value
